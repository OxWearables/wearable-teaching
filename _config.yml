 This is a tutorial series for machine learning in wearables. In this tutorial series, we will walk through 
 the whole life-cycle of a real-world machine learning project which consists of data collection, annotation, 
 processing and model construction. Even though these tutorials focus mainly on wearable devices, the development 
 pipeline we will work through can also be applied to other applications.
